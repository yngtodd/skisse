title: About Me
---

I am a post-bachelors researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab. I have the good fortune of working with the Biomedical Sciences, Engineering, and Computing (BSEC) group, where we employ a variety of computational approaches for biomedical applications. Most of my work centers around machine learning and optimization, particularly the distributed variety.

I am interested in optimization, robotics, control, and goal oriented learning.
