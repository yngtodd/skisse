title: About Me
---

I am a post-bachelors researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab, where I have the good fortune of working with the Biomedical Sciences, Engineering, and Computing (BSEC) group. We employ a variety of computational approaches for biomedical applications including machine learning, molecular dynamics simulation, and all sorts of other computational wizardry. Most of my work centers around machine learning and optimization, particularly the distributed variety.

I am interested in optimization, robotics, control, and goal oriented learning.
